				<p>
					Alex discovered his passion for mechanical timepieces—specifically vintage pocket watches, while completing his business degree at Portland State University. He quickly expanded his interest and expertise to a broad range of watches, and developed what has become a reputation for honesty, integrity and deep knowledge, conversant in the history, mechanics, operation, repair, and lore of the watch.
					<br><br>
					In 1991, together with his wife, Maureen, they opened Watchworks in a small storefront just down the street from their current location. Along with their Swiss-trained watchmaker, Paul Manney, they carefully grew the business to the point that Watchworks was receiving referrals from all the major local jewelers, eventually necessitating a significant expansion to their current 2800 sq. ft location in 1999, and adding a full line of fine jewelry.  Watchworks now employs eight professionals including a certified goldsmith and gemologist and appraiser.
